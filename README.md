# cache-simulator


It is a simple chache simulator for exploring the cache design and efficiency.
It shows how a cahce might handle hits, misses, and evictions.
I have designed the cache using a array of structs.

Done as a part of poroject for a semester for college.
So it contains files with test cases and a makefiles that compiles it all neatly.
